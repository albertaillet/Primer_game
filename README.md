## Problem description

You start with 100 dollars and are faced with a player that has a coin.
You can pay them 1 dollar to flip their coin and you can observe the outcome. The player can either be fair and have a unbiased coin or be a cheater and have a coin that comes up heads too ofter.
You get 15 dollars if you label the player correctly as a fair player or a cheater but you have to pay 30 dollars if you label them incorrectly.
When you have guessed the label of a player, they are replaced with another player.
You lose when you are in debt to a player (have less that 0 dollars left).

What is the optimal strategy if there is one.
Is it possible to play the game indefinitely?
